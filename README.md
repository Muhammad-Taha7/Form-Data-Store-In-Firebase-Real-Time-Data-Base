# React Signup Form with Strong Validation

**A clean, accessible, and secure React signup form** with real-time validations, toast notifications, and Firebase (Realtime Database) integration. Built with React + Tailwind CSS and lightweight icons from `lucide-react`.

## üî• Features

* ‚úÖ Field-level validation before submit (name, email, password, address)
* ‚úÖ Strong password enforcement (uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
* ‚úÖ Name limited to letters and spaces only
* ‚úÖ Address minimum length check
* ‚úÖ Toast notifications for success, warnings and errors
* ‚úÖ Firebase Realtime Database POST integration
* ‚úÖ Loading state during submission
* ‚úÖ Accessible and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

## üìÅ Project Structure (recommended)

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Toast.jsx
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Form.jsx
‚îú‚îÄ App.jsx
‚îú‚îÄ index.jsx
‚îî‚îÄ styles.css (Tailwind build)
```

> The example code provided includes `Form` and `Toast` in a single file for simplicity. You can split them into separate components for a cleaner architecture.

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules (what blocks fake data)

* **Name**: Required. Only letters and spaces allowed. (Regex: `^[A-Za-z\s]+$`)
* **Email**: Required. Must be a valid email format. (Standard email regex used)
* **Password**: Required. Minimum 6 characters and must include:

  * At least one uppercase letter
  * At least one lowercase letter
  * At least one digit
  * At least one special character (`@$!%*?&`)
  * (Regex example: `^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{6,}$`)
* **Address**: Required. Minimum length 10 characters to prevent meaningless addresses

These checks run before making the network request, so obviously malformed or placeholder data will be rejected client-side.

## üõ† Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Create a React project (Vite or Create React App recommended). Example with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm install
```

3. Install dependencies used in the example:

```bash
npm install lucide-react
# Tailwind setup if not already installed
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

4. Configure Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`) and import the CSS in your project entry.

5. Copy the provided `Form` and `Toast` components into your `src/components` folder or a single file as you prefer.

---

## üîß Environment / Firebase

The example posts to a Realtime Database endpoint. You should store your Firebase URL in an environment variable instead of hardcoding.

Example `.env` (Vite uses `VITE_` prefix):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_DB_URL=https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
```

Usage in code (example):

```js
const res = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_DB_URL}/firebasedatastore.json`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
```

## üß© How it works (high level)

1. User types into inputs bound to `user` state.
2. On submit, `validateForm()` runs client-side checks.
3. If validation passes, `postdata()` sends a POST to Firebase.
4. UI shows a loading spinner while awaiting response.
5. Toast shows success or error message. On success, the form resets.

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility & UX notes

* Inputs include clear placeholder and label text.
* Buttons show disabled state while submitting.
* Toast provides concise feedback and auto-hides after 5s.
* Consider adding `aria-live="polite"` to toast container for screen readers.

---

## ‚ú® Customization ideas

* Add live inline error messages beneath inputs for better UX.
* Replace Firebase with your own API or server (Node/Express).
* Add email verification (send confirmation link) and secure password storage (do not store raw passwords in production).
* Integrate form libraries like `react-hook-form` + `yup` for more scalable validation.

---

## üß™ Testing

* Unit test `validateForm()` logic with Jest by passing good and bad inputs.
* E2E test signup flow with Playwright or Cypress.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

In the provided example the password is sent as plain text to the Realtime Database which is **not secure for production**. For a production-ready app:

* Never store raw passwords. Use a backend and hash passwords with a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
* Use HTTPS (Firebase endpoints already use HTTPS).
* Add server-side validation and rate limiting.
